# PHONEMeS

**PHONEMeS** (**PHO**sphorylation **NE**tworks for **M**ass **S**pectrometry) is a method to model signalling networks based on untargeted phosphoproteomics mass spectrometry data and kinase/phosphatase-substrate interactions. 
Please see [Terfve et al.](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9033) for an explanation of the methodolgy and as an example for how to run a PHONEMeS analysis.

This repository contains the [R package](https://github.com/saezlab/PHONEMeS/tree/master/Package) and accompanying scripts that implement the method.
