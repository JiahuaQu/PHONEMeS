# Welcome to the PHONEMeS Documentation Page!

PHONEMeS (**PHO**sphorylation **NE**tworks for **M**ass **S**pectrometry) is a method to model signaling networks based on untargeted phosphoproteomics mass spectrometry data and kinase/phosphatase-substrate interactions.

This package contains the R package and accompanying scripts that implement the method as well as several examples of how to run a PHONEMeS analysis.
